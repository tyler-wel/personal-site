So what IS a blog? I’ve never been much of a social media person, and this is my first blog. I've always just been more of a lurker. An overwhelming majority of blogs these days seem to be tutorials, or maybe I'm just in the wrong places. To anyone reading this, what is a blog to you? A place to learn new skills or perspectives on things? Discussion zones?

I’m sure it’s going to take me awhile to get the hang of being a blogger, and I’ll be surprised if more than a single person ever reads this. But I guess you gotta start somewhere!
