Backend engineer with full-stack experience working in Tokyo, Japan. Languages used on a day to day basis include Ruby (Rails), Javascript (React), and Python (chat bots). I also have experience with AWS services including Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS, and IAM. Besides web development, I have interests in machine learning and reverse engineering, which is what I enjoyed learning the most at my time at Uni. Outside of work I mostly enjoy the typical nerd hobbies of video and tabletop games, spending much of my free time either gaming or painting miniatures.
