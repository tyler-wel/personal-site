Full-Stack developer working in Tokyo, Japan. Languages I've been using recently include Ruby on Rails, Javascript (VueJS), and Java as well as AWS services. I am also familiar with React and have recently been learning GoLang for this website. Besides web development, I have a large interest in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI for GameDev. On this site I'll be posting any of my notebooks that I feel aren't complete garbage for mostly educational purposes. Lastly, I have a love for coffee, dogs, and all things video games.
